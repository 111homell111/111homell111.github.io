                        <p>The summer of second year at UBC's Engineering Physics program is fondly called robot summer, as every student must compete in an intense, robot competition.</p>
                        <p>This year the competition was based on the game overcooked. The task was to design and build two robots that would work together to assemble fake dishes in a timed setting, similar to the game overcooked.</p>
                        <p>Team Members: Ella Yan, Brianna Gopaul, Tristan Brown, Nathan Tourveille</p>

                        <p>This year's competition was based on the game Overcooked, a game in which, multiple players have to work together to prepare and serve dishes in a timely manner.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Competition Overview</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Objective:</b> Build two robots to autonomously prepare and serve as many dishes (e.g., plastic salads, burgers, fries) within 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li><b>Key Tasks:</b> Robots must pick up, "chop", "cook", assemble, and serve dishes to earn points</li>
                            <li><b>Timeline:</b> Students are given approximately 6 weeks to bring up their robots from scratch</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Competition Surface</h6>   
                        <ul>
                            <li>8'x8' wooden surface with countertops 6" above the surface </li>
                            <li>Black electrical tape marks a straight path and locations of ingredients/cooktops</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Ingredients and Plates</h6>   
                        <ul>
                            <li>Coloured tape marks where ingredients/plates can be initially placed</li>
                            <li>Students are to place the ingredients in their specified locations and the robots must autonomously pick them up</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Recipes</h6>   
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many possible recipes ranging from cheese plate (cheese on a plate worth 1 point) to deluxe burger + fries + salad (worth 21 points)</li>
                            <li>More complex recipes are generally worth more points</li>
                            <li>Burger patties/fries must be cooked, meaning they must sit on the cooktop for 5-20s</li>
                            <li>Fries are connected via velcro and must be chopped (seperated) before serving</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Serving and Tips</h6>   
                        <ul>
                            <li>The serving area has no black tape indicator but rather has an IR beacon instead</li>
                            <li>Dishes like burgers can lose points if the presentation is sloppy (i.e. the pattie is about to fall out of the burger)</li>

                            <li>We wanted something that was fool-proof/100% doable in 6 weeks by us, a team of students with next to no mechanical CAD experience :D</li>
                            <li>We wanted both robots to have a very similar design to reduce the amount of work we had to do/increase our chances of finishing on time</li>
                            <li>We decided to go for a claw and chute design... (in hindsight this was very wacky but we were running out of time and just had to pick an idea and send it)</li>
                            <li>We decided to have our robot be extremely wide and only drive left/right, while making slight adjustments to stay on track</li>
                            <li>The reasoning for the claw was that the large sweeping motion would be robust against positioning errors</li>
                            <li>The reasoning for the chute was so we could produce a perfectly stacked burger each time</li>
                            <li>We did consider designs that could make multiple burgers at once, but decided they were not feasable in 6 weeks (which in hindsight was the right play)</li>

                        <h4>Detailed Design and Manufacturing</h4>
                        <p>One of my tasks during this project was to CAD the chassis, the claw and chute were designed by Tristan and Nathan </p>
                        <p>We decided to use two wheels, and two tennis balls for support. The tennis balls, though difficult to cut, worked surprisingly well! Their flexibility allows them to act as a suspension while the fuzziness lets them glide smoothly across the floor.</p>
                        <p>We designed the top half of our robot, holding the claw and chute, to rotate 180°. The reasoning was that we thought that operating a single servo would be easier than making our whole robot rotate (which runs the risk of becoming disoriented). In hindsight this feels a bit inelegant but hey, it still worked.</p>
                        <p>I cadded everything using OnShape and made an assembly to allow us to visualize where to mount servos and PCBs</p>

                        <p>One thing to note is that on a lot of ESP32 dev boards, some analog pins share hardware with the WiFi/wireless communication which renders them unusable when ESP-NOW/WiFi is in use! We learned this the hard way D:</p>

                        <p>This was our initial electrical block diagram generated during our planning phase. We ended up not using rotary encoders or IR beacon sensors (though Brianna's prototype was still really cool!). We also chose not to include the limit switches and IR beam breaks in the interest of time.</p>
                        <p>We chose give our motors a seperate ground as we didn't want the electrical noise to couple to our sensitive sensors and microcontroller. </p>

                        <h4>H-Bridge Circuit</h4>
                        <p>We made our own H-Bridge circuits to control our motors. On the right is a schematic showing how to control a motor using the LTC1161 motor driver IC. Our motor driver circuits were optoisolated from the rest of our circuit to contain noise.</p>
                        <h6>How does an H-Bridge Work?</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An efficient peer-to-peer communication protocol developed by Espressif specifically for ESP32 devices</li>
                            <li>Does not require connection to an external central network</li>
                            <li>Has low latency and low power consumption</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Completed PCB</h6>
                        <p>This circuit was quite irritating to solder by hand and we had to make one for each robot, so we chose to make PCBs (also for the learning experience).</p>
                        <p>The PCB features a circuit similar to the one shown above, but makes use of the fact that the LTC1161 can support two motors at once. It also featured testpoints and a power LED that came in real handy during debugging!</p>
                        <p>We chose to not use SMD components on our PCB, using only components available in our lab instead as we receive those components for free. This also made it a lot easier and cheaper to swap out faulty parts (cough cough MOSFETs).</p>
                        <p>My teammate Brianna made the PCBss while I reviewed them and gave her guidance/advice.</p>

                        <h4>Reflectance Sensors</h4>
                        <p>We used TCRT5000s to detect the black tape on the white competition surface.</p>
                        <p>These sensors consist of an IR LED and a phototransistor. They essentially work by emitting IR light and then measure the amount of light that bounces back.</p></p>
                        <p>In our application, we pointed the TCRT directly down on the competition surface to detect the tape. When the TCRT shone on the black tape, the light would be absorbed and we would read a very high analog value. When the TCRT shone on the white competition surface, we would read a very low analog value.</p>
                        <p>We chose to use analog readings from our TCRT instead of a digital reading (on the tape vs off the tape). This was because we had 8 TCRTs per robot and we wanted to be able to easily tune the tape threshold We didn't want to painstakingly tune each potentiometer (16 total) each time we wanted to recalibrate! We also noticed that when the TCRT was placed directly in the middle of the black tape, we would read a very high value and as we moved the sensor further from the middle of the tape, we found that the readings would slowly decrease.</p>
