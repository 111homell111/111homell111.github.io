                        <p>UBC Aerodesign, founded in 1992, is a student run engineering design team that competes in the annual SAE Aerodesign competiton. </p>
                        <p>The SAE aerodesign compeititon is an international collegiate design compeition with three categories to compete in, Advanced, Micro and Regular. </p>
                        <p>I've always worked on the avionics subteams here at UBC Aerodesign. I've been on Power and Controls, who are responsible for the plane's typical flight electronics and power circuitry, the power plant (motor and propellor combination) and trimming of the control surfaces. I'm currently on Sensors and Communications, a subteam who's role is to design hardware and firmware to collect clean and reliable sensor data to be used by our software teams algorithms.</p>

                        <p>I designed an airspeed sensor board so that the mechanical teams could have more data to aid in their design and analysis. </p>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">These boards are designed to collect data from a pitot tube and either save the data to an SD card, or to our main flight controller. Two versions of the board were made, one mini and one full. Both boards feature: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An MS4525DO airspeed sensor</li>
                            <li>An STM32F103 read data from the airspeed sensor via I2C and to act as a CAN controller</li>
                            <li>A CAN Transciever</li>
                            <li>Broken out SPI, I2C, CANRX/TX, and UART pins</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>A USB-UART converter (FDTI chip)</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Everything was designed in Altium Designer. I spent a good amount of time optimizing the BOM to reduce costs. All boards on our team, including this one, are ordered through JLCPCB (please sponsor us!). Here are pictures of the boards below.</p>

                        <p>The goal was to measure the current and voltage going to our propulsion circuit. We wanted to be able to see how much power our motor was consuming for a given power plant configuration, and how close we were to the power limit.</p>

I chose a hall effect sensor to avoid power losses in the propulsion circuit. I used differential amplifiers to amplify the output of the hall effect sensor, and put buffers on the voltage divider to ensure our output values matched our calculations.</p>

                        <p>Competition this year was in Van Nuys in California. It rained really hard half the time we were there but we still got in some good flight attempts. This year was more relaxed for our subteam as we had more members at comp ths year (four of us instead of one). Wiring everything was relatively simple compared to last year as we had our custom wiring hub which helped reduce the rats nest of wires in the plane. Here's some photos from the competition!</p>

                        <p>In 2023 UBC Aerodesign competed in the ADV Class Division and Regular Class Division.</p>
                        <p><b>ADV Goal: </b>The objective of the ADV class was to design an aircraft that could carry the maximum payload while also detecting colored ground targets. Upon identifying a target, the main aircraft would deploy a smaller autonomous plane, which would then navigate and land at the designated location.</p>
                        <p><b>REG Goal: </b>REG class's goal was to build a huge airplane that could carry plenty of payload while operating with an extremely low power limit.</p>
                        <p>This year I was a member on the Power and Propulsions subteam. We're in charge of keeping the plane powered as well as selecting a powerplant that will give us the best thrust. This was my first year on Aero!</p>

                        <p>One of Power and Propulsion's responsiblities is selecting the optimal motor and propellor combination for each plane. </p>
                        <p>Our planes are given a 750 Watt power limit (which is very low) so any extra bit of thrust we can get matters.</p>
                        <p>To select the optimal power plant configuration, we test various combinations in the wind tunnel. We had a lot of spare propellors and motors this year, so rather than buying new ones, we tested whatever was in our current inventory. </p>
                        <p>In some years we do some calculations based on Gudmundsson's General Aviation Aircraft Design textbook to decied which props/motors but we still always conduct wind tunnel tests to confirm our choice. </p>
                        <p>Out thrust stand consists of a load cell connected to an Arduino Uno. In future years we planned to add more load cells to get data on the torsion from the motor and propellor.</p>

                      <p><b>Altium:</b> I learned the basics of Altium this year (my first year of university). We were designing a custom flight controller carrier board and so I learned how to read and create schematics, how to create Altium components and their footprints, and how to route PCBs.</p>
                      <p><b>Soldering:</b> I also learned how to solder on my first year on the team. I soldered various wiring harnesses here and their. I believe I am currently very proficient at soldering.</p>
                      <p><b>Python:</b> I also did some general data analysis of the wind tunnel data using Python. I also worked on a GUI in Tkinter to automate wind tunnel testing.</p>

                        <p>This competition was super busy for me since I was the only person on my subteam who went (my lead didn't attend)!</p>
                        <p>I was responsible for ensuring both planes were powered, trimmed, and good to fly meaning our role was very critical on the field. I was responsible for running through all the pre-flight checks and ensuring we passed inspection. There's also the fact that I had to manage two planes that added to the stress.</p>
                        <p>Regardless, I enjoyed the challenge and had a wonderful time at competition! Here are some pictures from comp!</p>
